# server.markhome.msscf.msscf
MSS Code Factory 3.0

The logical domain server.markhome.msscf is not registered and hosted on the public internet, as this project is currently under internal development and virtually hosted in my own network. This code release is a preview, and I don't expect to be doing a production release until late 2026 to mid 2027. There is an incredible amount of code that needs refreshing and updating to fit my new visions of "how to internet."
