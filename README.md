# server.markhome.msscf.msscf
MSS Code Factory 3.0

server.markhome.msscf is a virtual environment within my home network, as this project is under internal development only at this point; this code release is just a preview, though you could fork the code and give it a proper domain name for the fork. I'd rather no one did that, though, as I do intend to host this project properly at some point over the next 12-18 months - I have other issues requiring my budgetary focus at this time.
